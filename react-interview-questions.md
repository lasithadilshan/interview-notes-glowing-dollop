### React Interview Questions and Answers

#### 1. What is React?
**Answer:**
React is an open-source JavaScript library used for building user interfaces, particularly single-page applications where data changes over time. It allows developers to create large web applications that can update and render efficiently in response to data changes.

#### 2. What are the main features of React?
**Answer:**
- **Virtual DOM**: React creates a virtual DOM in memory, which represents the UI. When the state of an object changes, React updates only the necessary parts of the UI.
- **JSX**: JSX is a syntax extension that allows mixing HTML with JavaScript.
- **Components**: React allows building encapsulated components that manage their own state, then compose them to make complex UIs.
- **One-way Data Binding**: React follows unidirectional data flow. It means data flows in one direction, making it easier to debug.

#### 3. What is a component in React?
**Answer:**
A component in React is a reusable piece of UI. It is a JavaScript function or class that optionally accepts inputs (props) and returns a React element that describes how a section of the UI should appear.

#### 4. What is the difference between a class component and a functional component?
**Answer:**
- **Class Component**: A class component requires you to extend from `React.Component` and create a render function that returns a React element. They can have state and lifecycle methods.
- **Functional Component**: A functional component is a plain JavaScript function that accepts props as an argument and returns a React element. They are stateless until the introduction of hooks.

#### 5. What are hooks in React?
**Answer:**
Hooks are functions that let you “hook into” React state and lifecycle features from function components. Examples include `useState`, `useEffect`, `useContext`, etc.

#### 6. What is the use of `useState` in React?
**Answer:**
`useState` is a hook that allows you to add state to functional components. It returns a stateful value and a function to update it.

#### 7. Explain the `useEffect` hook.
**Answer:**
`useEffect` is a hook that lets you perform side effects in function components. It serves the same purpose as `componentDidMount`, `componentDidUpdate`, and `componentWillUnmount` in React classes.

#### 8. What is the Virtual DOM?
**Answer:**
The Virtual DOM is an in-memory representation of the real DOM elements generated by React components before any changes are made to the web page. React updates the Virtual DOM first, then syncs it with the real DOM, ensuring efficient updates.

#### 9. What is JSX?
**Answer:**
JSX is a syntax extension for JavaScript that looks similar to XML or HTML. It is used with React to describe what the UI should look like. JSX is not mandatory to use in React but it's a common practice.

#### 10. What are props in React?
**Answer:**
Props (short for properties) are read-only attributes used to pass data from one component to another. They are passed to components via HTML attributes and are immutable.

#### 11. What is the difference between state and props?
**Answer:**
- **State**: State is a built-in object that stores property values that belong to a component. It is mutable and local to the component.
- **Props**: Props are used to pass data from parent to child components. They are immutable and read-only.

#### 12. How does data flow work in React?
**Answer:**
React follows a unidirectional data flow. Data flows from parent to child components via props. State is managed within components, and any changes to the state trigger re-rendering of the component and its children.

#### 13. What is the purpose of the `key` prop in React?
**Answer:**
The `key` prop is a special attribute used to identify which items in a list have changed, been added, or removed. It helps React to optimize rendering by keeping track of elements.

#### 14. What are higher-order components (HOC)?
**Answer:**
A higher-order component is a function that takes a component and returns a new component with additional props. HOCs are used to reuse component logic.

#### 15. What is Context API in React?
**Answer:**
The Context API is a feature that allows passing data through the component tree without having to pass props down manually at every level. It is used to share values like themes or user authentication status between components.
